{"name":"I2c-tools","tagline":"Mirror of http://lm-sensors.org/svn/i2c-tool","body":"I2C TOOLS FOR LINUX\r\n===================\r\n\r\nThis package contains an heterogeneous set of I2C tools for the Linux kernel\r\nas well as an I2C library. The tools were originally part of the lm-sensors\r\nproject but were finally split into their own package for convenience. The\r\nlibrary is used by some of the tools, but can also be used by third-party\r\napplications. The tools and library compile, run and have been tested on\r\nGNU/Linux.\r\n\r\nThe latest version of the code can be downloaded from:\r\n  http://www.lm-sensors.org/wiki/I2CTools\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n--------\r\n\r\nThe various tools included in this package are grouped by category, each\r\ncategory has its own sub-directory:\r\n\r\n* eeprom\r\n  Perl scripts for decoding different types of EEPROMs (SPD, EDID...) These\r\n  scripts rely on the \"eeprom\" kernel driver. They are installed by default.\r\n\r\n* eepromer\r\n  Tools for writing to EEPROMs. These tools rely on the \"i2c-dev\" kernel\r\n  driver. They are not installed by default.\r\n\r\n* include\r\n  C/C++ header files for I2C and SMBus access over i2c-dev. Installed by\r\n  default.\r\n\r\n* lib\r\n  The I2C library, used by eepromer, py-smbus and tools. Installed by\r\n  default.\r\n\r\n* py-smbus\r\n  Python wrapper for SMBus access over i2c-dev. Not installed by default.\r\n\r\n* stub\r\n  A helper script to use with the i2c-stub kernel driver. Installed by\r\n  default.\r\n\r\n* tools\r\n  I2C device detection and register dump tools. These tools rely on the\r\n  \"i2c-dev\" kernel driver. They are installed by default.\r\n\r\n\r\nLICENSE\r\n-------\r\n\r\nCheck the documentation of individual tools for licensing information.\r\nThe library is released under the LGPL version 2.1 or later, while most\r\ntools are released under the GPL version 2 or later, but there are a few\r\nexceptions.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThere's no configure script, so simply run \"make\" to build the library and\r\ntools, and \"make install\" to install them. You also can use \"make uninstall\"\r\nto remove all the files you installed. By default, files are installed in\r\n/usr/local but you can change the location by editing the Makefile file and\r\nsetting prefix to wherever you want. You may change the C compiler and the\r\ncompilation flags as well, and also decide whether to build the static\r\nlibrary or not.\r\n\r\nOptionally, you can run \"make strip\" prior to \"make install\" if you want\r\nsmaller binaries. However, be aware that this will prevent any further\r\nattempt to debug the library and tools.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to include sub-directories that are not enabled by default, then\r\njust set them via the EXTRA make variable. For example, to build py-smbus,\r\ndo:\r\n  $ make EXTRA=\"py-smbus\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDOCUMENTATION\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThe main tools have manual pages, which are installed by \"make install\".\r\nSee these manual pages for command line interface details and tool specific\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nThe other tools come with simple text documentation, which isn't installed.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS AND BUG REPORTS\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nPlease post your questions and bug reports to the linux-i2c mailing list:\r\n  linux-i2c@vger.kernel.org\r\nFor additional information about this list, see:\r\n  http://vger.kernel.org/vger-lists.html#linux-i2c\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
